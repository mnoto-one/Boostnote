### 💬 Creating a Comment

📝 Creating a Comment

```python

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

```
📝 Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

```python

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment.
```

📝 A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:


```python

#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

```
